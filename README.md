# Stronger Kind
This is an initial draft of a website for stronger kind. It was first created as the "Landing Page" of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) in the Foundations path.


## Hosting
It is hosted through GitHub pages here: [alexhermansson.github.io/stronger-kind](https://alexhermansson.github.io/stronger-kind/).


## Repository 
The first page is located in `index.html` and most of the styling in `style.css`. Some other pages and styling of those are located in `./pages`, there we have the following:

- `./pages/about.html`
- `./pages/gallery.html`
- `./pages/upcoming-events.html`
- `./pages/pages-styling.css`

## Future work
There is still some work todo:

- [X] Create the about page
- [ ] Create the gallery page
- [ ] Create the upcoming events page
